# Beastslash Community Rules
The Beastslash Community Rules apply to everyone who use and make Beastslash's products and services.

## Unacceptable behaviors
### Cheating
You can mod our games to make them more accessible and enjoyable for you, but don't ruin the experience for other people. 

### Impersonating others
You can roleplay as fictional characters, but don't maliciously impersonate anyone. If you are parodying someone, make it clear that you are not actually that person.

### Personally attacking others
Do not attack anyone based on their character.

### Revealing others' personal information
Do not reveal or threaten to reveal anyone's protected personal information.

Protected personal information includes:
* private addresses and GPS coordinates,
* government-issued identification cards,
* bank information,
* non-public contact information, and
* media featuring a person without their explicit permission.

Exercise caution when revealing your own personal information on the Internet.

### Dangerous off-platform behavior
We do not actively look for violations of the Community Rules outside of Beastslash products; however, certain dangerous off-platform behavior may cause us to react. Some behaviors include stalking, sexual harassment, physical harm, and grooming.

## Reprecussions
Reprecussions for violating the Beastslash Community Rules can include:
* Account suspensions and terminations.
* Disqualification from special events.
* Feature restrictions, such as chat mutes and world publishing bans.
* Random username and display name generation.
* Removal from special programs or groups.
* Other types of sanctions that we deem appropriate.
